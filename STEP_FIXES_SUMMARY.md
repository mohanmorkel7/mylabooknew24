# Lead Steps Management Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ **Drag and Drop Not Working / Steps Duplicating**

**Root Cause**: LeadDetails component was mixing template steps with actual lead steps in one draggable list.

**Solution Applied**:

- Separated template steps from lead steps in LeadDetails.tsx
- Template steps now shown as reference only (not draggable)
- Lead steps are the only draggable items
- Added visual distinction between template and lead steps

### 2. ✅ **Status Cannot Be Changed**

**Root Cause**: Status updates were attempted on template steps which don't have lead step records.

**Solution Applied**:

- Added validation in `DraggableStepsList.tsx` to prevent status updates on template steps
- Status dropdown disabled for template steps
- Clear error messages shown when attempting to update template steps

### 3. ✅ **Incorrect Steps Listed (Template vs Lead Steps)**

**Root Cause**: Backend was returning template steps as pseudo-lead steps, mixing data sources.

**Solution Applied**:

- Clear separation between template steps (reference) and lead steps (actual progress tracking)
- Template steps shown with blue styling and "📋 Template" badge
- Lead steps shown as normal trackable items
- Different UI sections for template reference vs actual lead progress

### 4. ✅ **Add/Delete Step Issues**

**Root Cause**: Delete attempts on template steps and confusion between step types.

**Solution Applied**:

- Delete button disabled for template steps
- Clear visual indicators for what can/cannot be modified
- Added proper error handling for delete operations
- Template steps clearly marked as non-deletable

## Visual Improvements

### Template Steps:

- 🔵 Blue styling with "📋 Template" badge
- Disabled drag handle with "cannot reorder" tooltip

### Lead Steps:

## UI/UX Improvements

### Empty State:

### Error Handling:
