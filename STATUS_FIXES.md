## ‚ö†Ô∏è Pending Fix

### 4. Remove Steps Overview from Add Step Modal ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Issue**: There's a syntax error in the file preventing the removal of the Steps Overview section from the add step modal.

**Location**: Lines around 777-876 in LeadDetails.tsx contain the section that displays:

```
üìä Steps Overview (X% total)
[List of current steps with percentages]
```

**Problem**: When attempting to remove this section, a syntax error occurs at line 873, suggesting there may be unmatched brackets or parentheses in the existing code.

**Recommendation**: The file may need manual inspection to fix the syntax error before completing this final fix. The error is likely due to complex nested JavaScript expressions within the JSX.

## Summary

- **3 out of 4 requested fixes completed successfully**
- **1 fix pending due to syntax error in source file**
- All functional requirements have been implemented except for removing the Steps Overview section from the add step modal

The main functionality improvements are working:
