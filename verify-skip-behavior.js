=== Testing Complete Skip Behavior ===

This test verifies that users existing in database are COMPLETELY skipped:

Test Data:
1. Maanas.m@mylapay.com (EXISTS in DB) - should be COMPLETELY SKIPPED
2. test-new-user@mylapay.com (NEW) - should be processed

Expected Results:
- Users in upload: 2
- Users passed database check: 1 (only the new user)
- New users added to JSON: 1 (only the new user)
- Skipped (found in database): 1 (Maanas)
- Database users were completely ignored: YES

The existing user should NOT be updated in any way.

To test manually:
1. Go to /admin/departments
2. Upload this JSON data:

console.log(JSON.stringify(testData, null, 2));

console.log(`
3. Check the response message
4. Verify that only 1 user was processed
5. Verify that Maanas was completely skipped
6. Check server logs for detailed processing info

Key indicators of success:
- "Completely skipping existing user: Maanas.m@mylapay.com (found in database - no processing)"
- "Users passed database check: 1" 
- "Database users were completely ignored: YES"
`);
